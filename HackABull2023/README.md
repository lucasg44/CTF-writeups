# Hack-a-Bull 2023

When competing for Hack-a-bull, I joined a team named "flag. txt". Hack-a-bull 2023 consisted of 50 competitors that spaned across 25 different teams.
I would like to thank the Whitehatters Computer Security Club, who not only organized these events, but also designed all the unique challenges that spanned across categories such as OSINT, Reverse Engineering, General Skills, Cryptography, etc.


Out of all competitors and teams, my team, "flag. txt" was able to get first place. With 1240 points total, my team took home the gold trophy. My team was able to solve 10 out of the 15 challenges that were available to players.
