### Overview
This challenge was a OSINT challenge as a part of CyberHack 2023, I solved this challenge completely on my own. This challenge was rated an easy challenge on Hackthebox.

### The Problem
Are you really committed to becoming an OSINT master? Because version-control and collaboration platforms may expose valuable information and Jonathan is using one of them.
