# Jon Tweets A Lot

### Overview
This challenge was a OSINT challenge as a part of CyberHack 2023, I solved this challenge completely on my own. This challenge was rated an easy challenge on Hackthebox.

### The Problem
Jonathan Witherson is a cybersecurity professional who tweets a lot of information. Can you find his first secret?

### The Solution
To complete this challenge, it is as simple as following the instructions. I looked up the name Jonathan Witherson on twitter and came across the profile in the link provided below:

When scrolling across the twitter profile, I didnt notice any outstanding flags in the tweets made, so I started to look in the comments of his tweets, to no luck. After that, I noticed one tweet that stood out to me. It was a tweet that said "Can you trust me?" with a QR code beneath it. I was a little skeptical, but after scanning the QR code I noticed that the QR code didn't provide a link to a website, but instead scanning the QR code revealed the flag itself.

### TL;DR
After checking out Jonathan Witherson on twitter, I saw he tweeted a QR code that contained the flag for the challenge.
